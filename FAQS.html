                What is Dengue? <span class="icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Dengue is a viral illness transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. It is characterized by sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash, and sometimes bleeding. The disease can range from mild to severe, with severe cases potentially leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which can be life-threatening. Dengue is common in tropical and subtropical regions and is a major public health concern in many countries. The virus is spread when an infected mosquito bites a person, and the person-to-person transmission does not occur.</p>

                What is Asthma? <span class="icon">+</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, making it difficult to breathe. This results in symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or early in the morning. Asthma can be triggered by various factors, including allergens (such as pollen, dust mites, and pet dander), respiratory infections, exercise, cold air, smoke, and air pollution.
                    
                    The exact cause of asthma is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Asthma can vary in severity, and while there is no cure, it can be managed with medications such as inhalers (bronchodilators and corticosteroids) and lifestyle adjustments to reduce triggers and improve breathing.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in the air sacs (alveoli) of one or both lungs. It can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. The infection leads to the air sacs filling with fluid or pus, which can impair oxygen exchange and cause difficulty breathing.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by Leptospira bacteria, which are typically found in the urine of infected animals, especially rodents, and can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with contaminated water, soil, or animal urine. The infection can occur when a person comes into contact with water or soil that has been contaminated with the bacteria, often through broken skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth).</p>

                What is Flu (Influenza)? <span class="icon">+</span>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious viral infection that affects the respiratory system, including the nose, throat, and lungs. It is caused by influenza viruses, which can mutate and change, leading to seasonal flu outbreaks. The virus spreads primarily through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and it can also spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Allergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, is an allergic reaction that affects the nasal passages. It occurs when the immune system overreacts to airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold, pet dander, or other environmental triggers. The immune system mistakenly identifies these harmless substances as harmful, leading to inflammation and irritation of the nasal lining.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, primarily affecting the nose and throat. It is caused by several different viruses, with rhinoviruses being the most common culprit. The cold is highly contagious and spreads through droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, often caused by viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections. It is commonly referred to as "stomach flu," although it is not caused by the influenza virus. The condition leads to symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and sometimes fever.</p>

                <p>Sinusitis, also known as a sinus infection, is the inflammation or swelling of the tissue lining the sinuses, which are air-filled cavities located behind the forehead, cheeks, eyes, and nose. Sinusitis can occur when the sinuses become blocked or inflamed due to infections, allergies, or other factors, preventing mucus from draining properly.</p>
