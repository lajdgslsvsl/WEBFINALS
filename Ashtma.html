          <h2>FAST FACTS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chronic Condition:</strong> Asthma is a long-term respiratory condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.</li>
            <li><strong>Triggers Vary:</strong> Common asthma triggers include allergens (such as pollen, dust mites, and pet dander), respiratory infections, physical activity, cold air, and smoke.</li>
            <li><strong>Manageable with Treatment:</strong> Although asthma cannot be cured, it can be effectively managed with medications (like inhalers and corticosteroids) and by avoiding known triggers.</li>

            <h1>Asthma</h1>
            <p>As we bundle up during the winter season, people with asthma may notice they have a tougher time breathing during cold weather events. </p>
            <br>
            <p>That's because when you breathe in dry, cold air, your airways start to narrow, making it hard to breathe. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Cold air can especially affect your airways when you are doing physical activities that make you breathe through your mouth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When you breathe through your mouth, the cold air can't be warmed by your nose first before moving to your lungs. </p>
            <br>
            <p>This may cause an asthma attack.</p>

        <h1>Causes of Asthma</h1>
        <p>Asthma symptoms vary from mild to severe and can occur suddenly or over time. They are triggered by various factors like allergens, exercise, or weather conditions. The key symptoms to look out for are:</p>
        <ul>
         <br> <li><strong>Shortness of breath:</strong> A feeling of not getting enough air, especially after physical activity or exposure to triggers.</li>
        
            <li><strong>Wheezing:</strong> A high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out.</li>
         <br>
            <li><strong>Chest tightness:</strong> The sensation of constriction in the chest area.</li>
         <br>
            <li><strong>Coughing:</strong> Often worse at night or early in the morning, this persistent cough can be a sign of inflamed airways.</li>
        <br>
        </ul>
        <p>These symptoms can be mild and go unnoticed, but severe cases may require immediate medical attention to avoid an asthma attack, which can be life-threatening if untreated.</p>

                <h1>Diagnosis</h1>
                <p>Asthma diagnosis involves a combination of medical history, physical exams, and tests to measure lung function. The goal is to determine whether the symptoms are consistent with asthma and to rule out other conditions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <br> <li><strong>Spirometry:</strong> A feeling of not getting enough air, especially after physical activity or exposure to triggers.A test that measures the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can expel it from your lungs.</li>
                <br>
                    <li><strong>Peak Flow Meter:</strong> This tool helps monitor how well your lungs are functioning by measuring your ability to breathe out forcefully.</li>
                 <br>
                    <li><strong>Methacholine Challenge Test:</strong>Methacholine is inhaled to check for airway sensitivity, which can confirm asthma</li>
                 <br>
                    <li><strong>Allergy Tests:</strong> Identifying specific allergens like dust mites or pollen that may trigger asthma symptoms.</li>
                <br>
                </ul>
                    <p>With a proper diagnosis, individuals can start appropriate treatment plans to manage their symptoms.</p>

          <h1>Treatment</h1>
          <p>Managing asthma involves long-term control and quick-relief strategies. The treatment approach focuses on reducing inflammation, controlling symptoms, and preventing attacks. Key treatments include:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
              <li><p><strong>Inhaled Corticosteroids:</strong> Reduce airway inflammation, the primary cause of asthma symptoms.</p><br></li>
              <li><p><strong>Short-Acting Bronchodilators:</strong> Used as quick-relief inhalers to relax tightened muscles around the airways during an asthma attack.</p><br></li>
              <li><p><strong>Leukotriene Modifiers:</strong> Oral medications that block chemicals in the immune system that cause inflammation and asthma symptoms.</p><br></li>
              <li><p><strong>Long-Acting Beta Agonists:</strong> These help prevent asthma symptoms, especially during the night or after exercise.</p><br></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Regular monitoring and adjusting medications ensure that the asthma stays well-controlled and that the person can lead a normal life.</p>

                    <br><ul>
                  <li>  <p>Avoiding Triggers: Identify and minimize exposure to allergens, such as pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and smoke.</p>
                    <br></li>
                   <li> <p>Air Quality Control: Use air purifiers and ensure good ventilation at home to reduce airborne irritants.</p>
                    <br></li>
                   <li> <p>Vaccinations: Get vaccinated for flu and pneumonia to avoid respiratory infections that can trigger asthma.
