            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Cause:</strong> The common cold is primarily caused by viruses, most often the rhinovirus, but also includes coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and RSV.</li>
                <li><strong>Highly Contagious:</strong> Cold viruses spread through respiratory droplets or by touching contaminated surfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Manageable Symptoms:</strong> While there’s no cure for the cold, symptoms can be managed with over-the-counter medications, rest, and hydration.</li>

                <h1>The Common Cold</h1>
                <p>The common cold is a viral infection caused by a variety of <strong>rhinoviruses</strong>, which are typically spread through respiratory droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Humans can become infected through contact with these droplets, either directly or indirectly through contaminated surfaces.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The infection can also occur through the eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>

                    <h1>Causes</h1>
                    <p>The common cold is primarily caused by viruses, with the rhinovirus being the most prevalent. Other viruses that can cause colds include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <br><li><strong>Rhinovirus:</strong> The most common virus responsible for the cold.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Coronaviruses:</strong> Other respiratory viruses that can lead to cold-like symptoms.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Adenoviruses:</strong> Viruses that can cause a variety of illnesses, including the common cold.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV):</strong> A virus that can cause cold-like symptoms, particularly in young children.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><p>These viruses spread easily from person to person, especially in crowded areas, via respiratory droplets or by touching contaminated surfaces.</p>

                    <h1>Symptoms</h1>
                    <p>Symptoms of the common cold typically appear 1 to 3 days after exposure to the virus and may last from a few days to about two weeks. Common symptoms include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <br><li><strong>Stuffy or runny nose:</strong> Congestion and clear nasal discharge are typical signs of a cold.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Sore throat:</strong> A scratchy or painful throat is a common early symptom.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Cough:</strong> Coughing often occurs as a result of mucus in the throat.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Sneezing:</strong> A common symptom triggered by irritation of the nasal passages.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Headache:</strong> Some people experience mild headaches as a result of sinus pressure.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Feeling tired or weak is common as the body fights off the virus.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><p>These symptoms can overlap with other respiratory infections, such as the flu, so it’s important to monitor them closely.</p>

                    <p>Diagnosing a common cold usually involves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <br><li><strong>Medical history and physical examination:</strong> A healthcare provider will assess symptoms and may inquire about recent exposure to sick individuals or high-risk environments.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Laboratory tests:</strong> There are typically no specific tests required, as the diagnosis is often based on clinical presentation. However, in some cases, a throat swab may be taken to rule out other infections like strep throat.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><p>With an accurate diagnosis, individuals can begin managing their symptoms effectively, as no specific antiviral treatment is required for the common cold.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <br><li><strong>Over-the-counter medications:</strong> These can help alleviate symptoms such as congestion, cough, and sore throat.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Rest and hydration:</strong> Staying well-hydrated and getting plenty of rest can support the immune system in fighting off the virus.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Home remedies:</strong> Warm fluids, throat lozenges, and humidifiers can provide additional relief.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><p>Since the cold is caused by a virus, antibiotics are not effective, and treatments generally focus on symptom management.</p>

                        <br><li><strong>Frequent hand washing:</strong> Regularly washing hands with soap and water can help reduce the spread of viruses.</li>
                        <br><li><strong>Avoiding close contact:</strong> Staying away from individuals who are sick can lower the risk of infection.</li>
