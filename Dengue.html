          <h2>FAST FACTS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chronic Condition:</strong> While dengue is primarily an acute illness, it can lead to complications like dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which may require ongoing care and follow-up in severe cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Triggers Vary:</strong> The main trigger for dengue is being bitten by an infected Aedes mosquito. However, certain factors like weakened immunity, prior infections, or environmental conditions (such as heavy rainfall leading to mosquito breeding sites) may influence the severity and likelihood of infection.</li>
            <li><strong>Manageable with Treatment:</strong> There is no specific cure for dengue, but its symptoms are manageable. Treatment focuses on supportive care, such as maintaining hydration and controlling fever. Severe cases may require hospitalization for closer monitoring.</li>

            <h1>Dengue</h1>
            <p>As the rainy season brings more moisture to the air, people in dengue-prone areas should be especially cautious of mosquito bites.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is because the Aedes mosquitoes that transmit the dengue virus thrive in areas with stagnant water, which are common during heavy rains. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The increased mosquito activity during these months raises the risk of infection, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and where standing water is left unchecked.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If bitten by an infected mosquito, the virus can cause a range of symptoms, from mild fever to severe complications like dengue hemorrhagic fever. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Taking steps to eliminate breeding sites and protect yourself from mosquito bites can help reduce your risk of contracting the disease.</p>

            <h1>Causes of Dengue</h1>
            <p>Dengue fever is primarily caused by the dengue virus, which is transmitted through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. There are four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4), and infection with one serotype does not provide immunity against the others. This means that a person can be infected multiple times, increasing the risk of severe symptoms with subsequent infections.</p>
            <ul>
             <br> <li>The bacteria are typically transmitted through direct contact with contaminated water, soil, or food.</li>
            
                <li>  Common transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with floodwater or areas contaminated by animal urine.</li>
             <br>
                <li> The infection can enter the body through broken skin, mucous membranes, or open wounds.</li>
             <br>
                <li>Leptospirosis is caused by the Leptospira bacteria, which can be found in the urine of infected animals, particularly rodents.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
            <p>In some cases, dengue can progress to severe dengue (also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever), which can be life-threatening and is characterized by severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, fatigue, and blood in vomit.

              <h1>Symptoms</h1>
              <p>The symptoms of dengue typically appear 4 to 10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito and can include:
              <ul>
               <br> <li>High fever: Sudden onset of fever, often one of the first signs of infection.</li>
              
                  <li> Severe headaches: Intense headaches that may persist.</li>
               <br>
                  <li> Pain behind the eyes: A deep, aching sensation behind the eyes.</li>
               <br>
                  <li>Joint and muscle pain: Pain in the muscles and joints, often in the calves and back.</li>
              <br>
          </ul>
          In some cases, leptospirosis can progress to severe forms, leading to complications such as liver damage, kidney failure, meningitis, or respiratory distress, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms may include jaundice, confusion, rapid breathing, and severe muscle pain. Immediate medical treatment is crucial to manage severe cases and prevent long-term health issues.</p>

                <ul>
                 <br> A history of recent travel to areas where dengue is endemic.</li>

                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><strong>Hydration:</strong> Ensuring adequate fluid intake is crucial, especially in severe cases where intravenous fluids may be necessary.</p><br></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Pain relief:</strong> Medications such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be used to relieve pain and reduce fever. However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen should be avoided due to the risk of bleeding.</p><br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In severe cases, hospitalization may be required for close monitoring and treatment.</p>

                      <p> Preventing dengue primarily involves reducing mosquito exposure and breeding. Key preventive measures include:</p>
                      <br><ul>
                    <li>  <p>Using mosquito repellent: Apply repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus.</p>
                      <br></li>
                     <li> <p>Wearing protective clothing: Long sleeves and pants can help reduce mosquito bites.</p>
                      <br></li>
                     <li> <p> Eliminating standing water: Mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, so it's important to remove any sources of standing water around homes.
                    </p></li>
                    <li> <p>By following these preventive measures, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of contracting dengue fever.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
                      <br>
                      <p>Regular monitoring and adjusting medications ensure that the asthma stays well-controlled and that the person can lead a normal life.</p>
