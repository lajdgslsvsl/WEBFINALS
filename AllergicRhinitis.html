          <h2>FAST FACTS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chronic Condition:</strong> Allergic rhinitis is an ongoing condition where the immune system overreacts to allergens. In cold weather, increased indoor allergens like dust mites and pet dander can exacerbate symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Triggers Vary:</strong> Exposure to allergens such as dust, mold, and pet dander, which are more prevalent indoors during cold weather, often triggers allergic rhinitis. Cold air itself can also aggravate symptoms for some individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Manageable with Treatment:</strong> Allergic rhinitis can be managed with antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, and decongestants. Avoiding triggers and using air purifiers in the home can also help reduce symptoms. Severe cases may require consultation with an allergist.</li>

            <h1>Allergic Rhinitis</h1>
            <p>Allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is an allergic reaction that affects the nasal passages. During the colder months, the incidence of allergic rhinitis can increase due to heightened exposure to indoor allergens such as dust mites, pet dander, and mold. These allergens thrive in warm, humid environments, which are more common indoors during winter.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cold weather also leads to people spending more time indoors, which increases the likelihood of exposure to these allergens. Additionally, cold air can irritate the nasal passages, making symptoms like sneezing, congestion, and runny nose worse.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Allergic rhinitis can be triggered by allergens when inhaled, causing the immune system to overreact. It is important to minimize exposure to known allergens by using air purifiers, regularly cleaning the home, and considering medications such as antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids. Managing the environment during the cold months can help alleviate symptoms and prevent flare-ups.</p>

            <h1>Causes</h1>
            <p>Allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, is a condition where the immune system reacts to specific allergens, leading to symptoms like sneezing, nasal congestion, and itchy eyes. The most common triggers for allergic rhinitis include:</p>
            <ul>
                <br><li><strong>Pollen:</strong> Pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds is a major trigger, particularly during certain seasons, causing seasonal allergic rhinitis.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Mold spores:</strong> Mold thrives in damp, indoor environments and can provoke allergic reactions when inhaled.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Dust mites:</strong> These tiny creatures live in household dust and are common allergens, especially in warm, humid indoor settings.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Pet dander:</strong> Proteins found in the skin flakes and saliva of pets, especially cats and dogs, can trigger allergic rhinitis in susceptible individuals.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><p>Allergic rhinitis can cause significant discomfort and interfere with daily activities. Managing the condition often involves avoiding known allergens, using air purifiers, and taking medications such as antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids to alleviate symptoms.</p>

              <h1>Symptoms</h1>
              <p>Symptoms of allergic rhinitis can vary in intensity and may include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <br><li><strong>Sneezing:</strong> Frequent sneezing, especially when exposed to allergens like pollen or dust mites.</li>
                  <br><li><strong>Nasal congestion:</strong> Swelling of the nasal passages that causes difficulty breathing through the nose.</li>
                  <br><li><strong>Runny nose:</strong> A clear, watery discharge from the nose is common during flare-ups.</li>
                  <br><li><strong>Itchy eyes, nose, or throat:</strong> Itching often affects the eyes, nose, and throat.</li>
                  <br><li><strong>Postnasal drip:</strong> Excess mucus draining down the back of the throat, causing irritation and coughing.</li>
                  <br><li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Disrupted sleep from symptoms can lead to daytime fatigue.</li>
              </ul>
              <br><p>Managing these symptoms often involves avoiding allergens, using medications like antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids, and maintaining a clean environment to reduce exposure to triggers.</p>

                <h1>Diagnosis</h1>
                <p>Diagnosing influenza typically involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <br><li><strong>Medical history and physical examination:</strong> A healthcare provider will evaluate symptoms and may ask about recent exposure to sick individuals or high-risk environments.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Laboratory tests:</strong> Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) can detect the virus in respiratory specimens, providing quick results. However, these tests may not always be accurate, and more sensitive tests like PCR (polymerase chain reaction) may be used for confirmation.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><p>With an accurate diagnosis, individuals can begin the appropriate treatment plan to manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <br><li><strong>Antihistamines:</strong> These medications help reduce sneezing, itching, and runny nose by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance involved in allergic reactions.</li>
                            <br><li><strong>Nasal corticosteroids:</strong> These sprays effectively reduce inflammation and nasal congestion, providing long-term relief.</li>
                            <br><li><strong>Decongestants:</strong> These medications can provide temporary relief from nasal congestion by narrowing blood vessels in the nasal passages.</li>
                            <br><li><strong>Allergy shots (immunotherapy):</strong> For more severe cases, allergy shots may be recommended to gradually desensitize the immune system to specific allergens, reducing the severity of symptoms over time.</li>

<p>Preventive measures for influenza include:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <p>While allergic rhinitis cannot be completely prevented, individuals can take steps to minimize exposure to allergens:</p>
<ul>
    <br><li><strong>Avoid known triggers:</strong> Stay indoors during high pollen seasons and use air purifiers to filter out allergens from the air.</li>
    <br><li><strong>Maintain a clean environment:</strong> Regular cleaning, including washing bedding and vacuuming with a HEPA filter, can help reduce dust mites and mold.</li>
    <br><li><strong>Use protective measures:</strong> Wearing masks during outdoor activities, especially in areas with high pollen, can help reduce exposure to allergens.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>By understanding these aspects of allergic rhinitis, individuals can better manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.</p>
